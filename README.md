# Pdf-Analysis
I used the library pdfminer of Python to dump all the headers and contents, except stream objects and save it as txt file. Then I use the library difflib of Python to compare two txt files. The result is shown in the result.html file, which is attached.  I found in the trailer of the txt file, 3 part of trailers of the pdf sent from  you have been deleted. They are marked green in the html page.
Also, I found the format of my original pdf is pdf but the format of the pdf sent from you is data, which is shown in the image difference, also attached.
